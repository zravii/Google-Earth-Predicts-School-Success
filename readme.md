# Google Earth Predicts School Success

## Overview

This project, **Google Earth Predicts School Success**, investigates the correlation between **aerial views of schools** and **student success** using the **ResNet50 neural network** model. By analyzing zoomed-in and zoomed-out images of schools and their surrounding areas, the project explores how school environments and neighboring areas influence educational outcomes.

### Key Features:
- **ResNet50 Architecture**: Utilized the **ResNet50** neural network to predict student success based on aerial images.
- **Zoomed-in vs. Zoomed-out Images**: 
  - **Zoomed-in images** focusing solely on the school achieved a **53.9% accuracy**.
  - **Zoomed-out images** incorporating neighboring areas resulted in an improved accuracy of **62.09%**.
- **Image Augmentation**: Implemented diverse augmentation techniques to enrich the dataset and enhance **model performance**.
- **Contextual Analysis**: Examined how **neighboring areas** impact student success, providing a broader understanding of environmental factors.

## Objectives:
- Investigate the relationship between **aerial views** of schools and student success.
- Compare results between **zoomed-in** images of schools and **zoomed-out** images incorporating surrounding areas.
- Apply **image augmentation** to optimize the dataset for better generalization.
- Achieve validation accuracies ranging from **53.9% to 62.09%** by analyzing different scales of aerial images.

## Achievements:
- Developed predictive models using **ResNet50** based on both zoomed-in and zoomed-out aerial images.
- Achieved a **53.9% accuracy** using zoomed-in images of schools.
- Improved accuracy to **62.09%** when zoomed-out images included **neighboring areas**.
- Performed a comprehensive analysis of the impact of **surrounding areas** on student success.
